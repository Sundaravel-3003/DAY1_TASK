A javaScript object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and method). 
For example: car, pen, bike, chair, glass, keyboard, monitor etc.

JavaScript is an object-based language. Everything is an object in JavaScript.


Creating Objects in JavaScript

There are 3 ways to create objects.

    * By object literal
    * By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword)
    * By using an object constructor (using new keyword)

syntax for creating a odject -

object={property1:value1,property2:value2.....propertyN:valueN}

example

let person = { name : 'xyz', age : 20, }

here inside a object we should write in a certain format

  object = { key : value }

in the above example key are name and age,value are xyz and 20

we can define anything as a odject in js
all the varialbes are used as objects in js
for example strings,integers,boolean etc

we can also create sub objects inside an object

we can also overwrite the values of the key used inside an object


object created by object literal method -
let person = { name : 'xyz', age : 20, }


object created by instance directly -
here we create a NEW keyword.
example 

let person = new object();
person.name = "xyz";
person.age = 20;


object created by using a object constructor -
here we have to first create a function with arguments
then each argument value is assigned to the object by THIS keywords

function person(name,age)
{
this.name = name;
this.age = age ;
}

e = new person( "xyz",20 );
